# OpenSendForm — sprint history (append-only)

## 2026-08-20 — Sprint 0: bootstrap
- Branch: main (direct; pre-code, human-pushed)
- Repo initialised, devcontainer (PHP 8.1 + Node 20 + Claude Code +
  Mailpit sidecar) added, standing orders (CLAUDE.md) and state files
  seeded. No application code. No tests.

## 2026-08-21 — Devcontainer hotfix (PR #1)
- Branch: fix/devcontainer-yarn-key → merged to main via PR #1.
- Removed a stale Yarn apt repository/signing key from the base image
  Dockerfile that broke `apt-get update` during container build.
  Recorded here for completeness; work predates Increment 0.

## 2026-08-21 — Increment 0: application skeleton
- Branch: feature/increment-0-skeleton (off latest main).
- Housekeeping: tracked `.devcontainer/devcontainer-lock.json` and the
  updated `.claude/settings.json` (adds `git checkout` permission).
- Composer project `opensendform/opensendform` (MIT, PHP >=8.1). Deps:
  slim/slim ^4, slim/psr7, php-di/php-di, phpunit (dev) — exactly the
  authorised set. Scripts: `test` (phpunit), `serve` (php built-in
  server on :8080 from public/).
- Front controller `public/index.php` → `src/AppFactory.php`, which
  builds the Slim app + php-di container and is drivable from tests via
  `$app->handle()` (no HTTP serving in the factory).
- `src/Config.php`: defaults + env overrides (APP_ENV, SMTP_HOST,
  SMTP_PORT, DB_DSN); default DB `sqlite:var/data/opensendform.sqlite`;
  blank/false env values fall back to defaults; no secrets in code.
- Storage: `src/Storage/Database.php` (thin PDO wrapper, exceptions on,
  prepared statements only, sqlite + mysql) and
  `src/Storage/MigrationRunner.php` (numbered .sql, ordered, tracked in
  `schema_migrations`, idempotent, per-migration transaction).
  `migrations/001_create_schema_migrations.sql` creates the tracking
  table only — no domain tables.
- One route: `GET /health` → 200 `{"status":"ok","version":"0.0.1"}`;
  version sourced from `src/Version.php` (single constant).
- `var/` contents gitignored, directory kept via `.gitkeep`; vendor/
  remains ignored.
- Tests (PHPUnit, phpunit.xml at root): `/health` via the factory;
  migration runner clean apply + idempotent second run on in-memory
  sqlite; Config env-override behaviour.
- README: added a Development "Getting started" section (reopen in
  container, composer install/test/serve, Mailpit at localhost:8025).
- Test results: **OK — 8 tests, 22 assertions, all green.** Smoke-tested
  `/health` via `php -S` (200 + expected JSON; unknown route → 404).
- Deviations from prompt: none. No new/unauthorised Composer deps.
  QUESTIONS.md unchanged (no blockers).
